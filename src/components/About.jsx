        I'm Diaz, an 19-year-old Information Technology student at Universitas
        Gadjah Mada. My passion for software engineering is rooted in a desire
        for Deep Technical Mastery and structured problem-solving. I specialize
        in building highly performant and user-centric web applications,
        leveraging modern frameworks like Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I actively
        seek out and thrive on complex challenges, from optimizing real-time
        data flow to focusing on end-to-end scalability. My commitment is clear:
        to deliver robust, cutting-edge software solutions that prioritize both
        speed and elegant architecture.
